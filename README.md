# SMSM: Simplistic Minecraft Server Manager

A Windows service to help you run a Minecraft server, taking care of only the operation, and getting out of the way otherwise.

This is intended for people who know how to set up and configure a Minecraft server without hand-holding.

**(Intended) Features:**
- Runs as a Windows service
- Supports multiple independent instances on the same machine
- Allows scheduling of actions
- Can take backups of the world
- Doesn't fuck up your configs

Thanks AMP for giving me the incentive to learn how to implement a Windows service :)
